              <p>
                I served in the United States Marine Corps from June 2012 to
                June 2016, completing two active-duty deployments and earning
                the rank of Corporal. Throughout my service, I developed a
                strong foundation in leadership, technical proficiency, and
                operational planning—skills that continue to influence my
                professional approach today.

                crew-served weapons systems, as well as the training, welfare,
                and mission-readiness of my team. I routinely operated in
                high-pressure environments that demanded precise coordination,
                adaptability, and strategic thinking.
                <br />
                <br />
                In 2015, I deployed with 1st Battalion, 2nd Marine Regiment to
                Japan, where we conducted bilateral training exercises with both
                the Japan Self-Defense Force and the Republic of Korea Marine
                Corps. During this deployment, I was promoted to the rank of
                Corporal, recognizing my ability to lead by example and mentor
                junior Marines. I also served in roles requiring logistical
                coordination, equipment accountability, and cross-cultural
                communication—skills that translated directly to project
                management and systems-based thinking.

                I was honorably discharged in June 2016. My time in the Marine
                Corps instilled in me a results-driven mindset, strong attention
                to detail, and the ability to lead and execute under
                pressure—qualities I now apply to every professional challenge I
                take on.

                After completing my service in the Marine Corps, I enrolled at
                Robert Morris University, where I pursued a Bachelor’s Degree in
                Computer Information Systems with a concentration in Software
                Development. I began my studies in the Fall of 2016 and
                graduated in the Spring of 2020.
                <br />
                <br />
                Throughout my academic journey, I balanced a full-time job
                during my first two years, developing strong time management
                skills and a disciplined work ethic. In the summer of 2019, I
                secured a seasonal role that led to an internship with Meaden &
                Moore, eventually earning a position as a Staff Consultant. This
                experience gave me hands-on exposure to business systems,
                client-facing consulting work, and the application of technical
                solutions in real-world environments.
                <br />
                <br />
                My final semester coincided with the onset of the

                Classes shifted to remote learning, career fairs and networking
                events were canceled, and job prospects became uncertain.
                Despite the disruption, I remained focused on completing my
                degree and adapting to a rapidly changing academic and
                professional landscape. Navigating this period required
                resilience, flexibility, and a self-driven mindset—qualities I
                carry with me into every project and professional engagement.

                My time at Meaden & Moore began in 2019 while I was still
                completing my degree at Robert Morris University. I joined the
                Management Consulting Services division as an intern, where I
                was introduced to enterprise resource planning (ERP) solutions
                with a focus on both systems implementation and talent and
                leadership development. During my internship, I concentrated on
                understanding standard ERP workflows and had the opportunity to
                shadow senior managers on client-facing projects involving
                system analysis, process flow design, and documentation.
                <br />
                <br />
                As I gained hands-on experience, I began working specifically
                with Bizowie Cloud ERP—a cloud-based platform—learning its
                architecture and integration methods. Upon completing my
                internship, I was offered a full-time role as a Staff
                Consultant.
                <br />
                <br />
                In this role, I expanded on my foundational skills and took on
                greater responsibility. I conducted one-on-one client training
                sessions across multiple ERP modules, performed on-site
                discovery and needs assessments, and managed client accounts and
                relationships. I also developed custom reports and
                correspondence tools tailored to client requirements, using a
                combination of HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, and the Templatetool Kit.
                These tools retrieved and processed data via Bizowie Cloud ERP’s
                API. Additionally, I created custom scripts and automation
                solutions to streamline client workflows, using primarily
                JavaScript and Templatetool Kit.
                <br />
                <br />
                My time at Meaden & Moore concluded in early 2022, marking the
                end of a highly formative chapter in my career. The experience
                sharpened both my technical and interpersonal skills and
                strengthened my ability to deliver tailored, scalable solutions
                to clients across a range of industries.

              <h4>2022 - Current</h4>
              <p>
                I joined Moonlight N’Stuff in 2022 as a Lead Software Developer
                and Project Manager, though my role encompasses much more than
                the title suggests. Moonlight N’Stuff is a marketing and web
                development agency founded by Kyle Flynn, composed of a small,
                agile team with diverse professional backgrounds. As the sole
                developer and ERP expert on the team, I’ve played a key role in
                expanding the company’s technical capabilities and service
                offerings.
                <br />
                <br />
                While I continue to work with Bizowie Cloud ERP, my current
                focus has shifted more heavily toward front-end web development
                and full-cycle project management. One of my most significant
                contributions has been the design and oversight of a custom
                in-house ERP system currently in development for a client. I’m
                managing the entire ERP project, collaborating with a senior
                full-stack developer who brings over 12 years of experience to
                the build. I lead all project planning, client communication,
                and timeline execution—ensuring we meet key milestones
                consistently. We are on track for a client go-live in January
                2026, with plans to publicly launch the platform by late 2026 or
                early 2027.
                <br />
                <br />
                In addition to managing this large-scale ERP initiative, I am
                also responsible for developing all system correspondences and
                reporting features, utilizing Svelte, JavaScript, TailwindCSS,
                and standard CSS. My broader front-end development work includes
                everything from full-site redesigns to building custom web
                pages, using technologies such as HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap 5, and
                JavaScript.

              </h2>
              <p>
                My professional development is a continuous and intentional
                process. I believe that staying competitive in the tech
                industry—especially in areas as dynamic as web development and
                ERP systems—requires constant learning and adaptation. I
                regularly attend webinars, technical workshops, and virtual
                conferences to stay current with new tools, best practices, and
                emerging trends across both the software development and
                enterprise systems landscapes.
                <br />
                <br />
                Whether it’s advanced ERP implementation strategies or a
                refresher on core programming principles, I actively seek out
                courses at all levels. I take both beginner and advanced
                training modules to broaden my foundation and strengthen
                overlooked areas. I’m especially passionate about ERP systems,
                and I invest time in exploring new features, API capabilities,
                and workflow improvements for platforms like Bizowie Cloud ERP.
                I also keep up with ERP-focused forums, documentation releases,
                and user communities to stay informed and troubleshoot
                real-world scenarios.
                <br />
                <br />
                Beyond formal learning, I follow senior developers, ERP
                architects, and tech thought leaders on platforms like LinkedIn
                and GitHub to stay engaged with current practices in system
                design, scalability, integration, and business process
                optimization. These insights help me bridge the gap between
                technical implementation and operational impact—something
                especially valuable in ERP consulting and development.
                <br />
                <br />
                I also engage in conversations with other developers and
                consultants, exchanging ideas and problem-solving strategies via
                Slack channels, Discord communities, and local meetups. Reading
                industry blogs, tech journals, and whitepapers is part of my
                regular routine, as is experimenting with new tools and
                frameworks in sandbox environments. This hands-on approach helps
                me stay sharp and assess how new solutions can fit into existing
                systems or workflows.
                <br />
                <br />
                In addition, I contribute to internal documentation, mentor team
                members, and translate complex technical concepts for
                non-technical stakeholders—especially in ERP-related projects
                where cross-functional clarity is key. Whether I’m building
                custom modules, automating business processes, or designing
                client-facing reports, I treat every project as an opportunity
                to refine my skills and deliver impactful solutions.
                <br />

                Ultimately, I view my profession as a craft—one that is
                constantly evolving. My goal is not only to stay current but to
                become a driving force in both development and ERP
                implementation through continuous learning, collaboration, and a
                relentless focus on real-world value.

                Outside of my professional work, I’m an avid gamer with a
                particular love for RPGs and ARPGs. I enjoy the challenge and
                strategic depth these games offer, especially titles with rich
                lore, complex mechanics, and character customization. Gaming has
                always been more than entertainment for me—it sharpens my
                problem-solving skills and fuels my creativity.
                <br />
                <br />
                I’m also a lifelong reader, especially drawn to fantasy and
                historical literature. Whether it's the sprawling worlds of high
                fantasy or the detailed accounts of real-world events, I
                appreciate stories that offer new perspectives and immersive
                narratives. This passion for storytelling informs how I approach
                user experience and design—always with an eye toward clarity,
                depth, and engagement.

                Music is another key part of my life, and my taste spans all
                genres—from heavy bass drops to classical, metal, and beyond. I
                find music energizing and often use it to stay focused while
                coding or working on creative projects.
                <br />
                <br />
                When I’m not behind a screen, I enjoy working both outdoors and
                indoors on my home and property. Whether it's landscaping, small
                renovations, or hands-on problem-solving around the house, I
                find the process satisfying and rewarding. I'm also committed to
                personal fitness—I hit the gym regularly and incorporate running
                into my weekly routine. These habits keep me disciplined,
                focused, and balanced in all areas of life.
